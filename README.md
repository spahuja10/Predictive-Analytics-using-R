Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning | R (Logistic Regression, Classification, K-Means, KNN, CART, PCA)
•	Built supervised and unsupervised ML models in R including Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Trees (CART), K-Means Clustering, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict outcomes and segment data
•	Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature engineering, evaluating model performance through confusion matrices, ROC curves, and validation metrics
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis and stationarity testing to identify patterns, outliers, and data quality issues prior to model development
